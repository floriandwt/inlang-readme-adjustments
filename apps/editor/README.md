# Globalize your codebase, without touching code

inlang's Web Editor enables you to translate messages in your repository without having to write own code.

### Perfect for
- Translators
- Designers
- Visual-driven people

## Step-by-step

### 1. Open the [Web Editor](https://inlang.com/editor)

### 2. Select a repository 

If you've used the editor before, you can choose from your latest repositories. Otherwise, you are able to paste the link to your repository. After opening it, inlang will look up your project settings and translations. Depending on the size of the repository, it can take up to a few minutes.

### 3. Translate messages and push changes

As soon as the repository is loaded, you can start making changes and translating messages. Your changes are automatically saved and if you are done, you can directly commit your changes. Through this procedure, all other stakeholders working on the same codebase will always work with the same source of truth.
